        <h1 class="title">Alistar</h1>
        <h3>Many civilizations have resisted Noxus, but none as long as the clans of the Great <br> Barrier mountains. Though these fierce minotaurs had protected the overland trade <br> routes to the ancient city of Zaun for centuries, they preferred to avoid Valoran’s <br> wider conflicts. <br> <br>
            The noble warrior Alistar was respected among all the clans. Out on the mountain <br> peaks, his roar could scatter even the bravest trespassers, leaving only the foolhardy <br> to face him in combat. Even so, in the moot halls he would always urge his kin to <br> forge greater bonds with other mortal races. Many saw minotaurs as little more <br> than beasts, which soured any interaction and kept them firmly as outsiders. <br><br>
            Then Noxus came, promising something better. Their emissary, the matriarch of <br> House Tewain, proclaimed that the empire was poised to take Basilich, a coastal city <br> to the east. However, she pledged that they would not do this without the support <br> of the great clans of the mountains, and called for parley on neutral ground.</h3>
